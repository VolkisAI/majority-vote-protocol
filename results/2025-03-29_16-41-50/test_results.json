  "problem_description": "You have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $q$ painters to paint it. $i$-th painter will paint all sections $x$ such that $l_i \\le x \\le r_i$.\n\nUnfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $q - 2$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.\n\nYou want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $q - 2$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \\le n, q \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.\n\nThen $q$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 maximum number of painted sections if you hire $q - 2$ painters.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 5\n1 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n3 5\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n4 3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 4\n1 1\n2 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\n3",
