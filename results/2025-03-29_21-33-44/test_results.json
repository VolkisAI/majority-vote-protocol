  "problem_description": "Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.\n\nA time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.\n\nNote that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.\n\nFormally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x\u00b7y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.\n\nJamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 60).\n\nThe second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 \u2264 hh \u2264 23, 00 \u2264 mm \u2264 59).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n11 23\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n01 07\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.\n\nIn the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.",
